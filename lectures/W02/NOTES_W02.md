# Week 2

## Last Time

Last time we went introduced the binary number system. We said that binary
is a base 2 number system, meaning it only contains 2 digits. Unlike our
decimal system which contains 10 digits, 0-9, the binary system contains two
binary digits, or bits, 0 and 1. We also introduced the concept of hexadecimal, 
a base 16 number system. Hexadecimal (often simply "hex" for short) uses
digits 0-9 and A-F (where A=10, B=11, etc.).

We showed how these can be different ways of representing the same information.
For example the number 0xFF in hex (sometimes written FFh) represents the 
decimal number 255 or the binary number 11111111. In this case, we have 8 bits,
which we call a byte. A byte is typically the fundamental size of information
used on a computer. We often hear the terms gigabyte, megabyte, and kilobyte
when referring to file sizes or storage capacity. These are simply billions, 
millions, and thousands of bytes, respectively.

We showed how we can map values to letters using [ASCII](http://www.asciitable.com/).
This allows us to use a single byte (8 bits) to represent all kinds of information.
We can string together a collection of bytes each representing characters to
form much more meaningful information.
